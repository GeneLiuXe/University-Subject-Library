The abstract goes here. The abstract should be self-contained and:
\begin{itemize}
    \item clearly state the problem dealt with by the thesis; \item give a synthetic description of the proposed solution;
    \item  highlight the sense in which the proposed solution enhances the state of the art.
\end{itemize}
