#
# Makefile for building user programs to run on top of Nachos
#
# Several things to be aware of:
#
#    Nachos assumes that the location of the program startup routine (the
# 	location the kernel jumps to when the program initially starts up)
#       is at location 0.  This means: start.o must be the first .o passed 
# 	to ld, in order for the routine "Start" to be loaded at location 0
#

# Changes at Waterloo:  
#     o Cross-compilation is handled automatically by the Makefile now.
#         - when necessary, it assumes that /software/gcc_nachos exists, 
#           which is true on cayley, napier, descartes.
